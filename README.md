# Project Title:

**Coding Interview Patterns with Java ‚òïÔ∏è ‚Äî Tutorials & Practice Questions**

## 1. Project Description

This repository is a comprehensive guide for preparing coding interviews using common algorithmic patterns. Each topic includes:

* Conceptual tutorials
* Sample problems
* Java-based solutions
* Structured practice roadmap

The project is organized by skill level to help learners strengthen problem-solving techniques gradually.


## 2. Prerequisites

Before diving into practice problems, ensure you're familiar with:

* Java programming basics
* Java Collections

    * Interfaces: `Set`, `List`, `Queue`, `Deque`
    * Implementations: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `PriorityQueue`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, etc.
* Core data structures and algorithms

    * Structures: Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph
    * Algorithms: Sorting, Searching

## 3. Pattern-Based Structure

### üü¢ Fundamental Patterns:

* Two Pointers
* Fast and Slow Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Merge Intervals
* Cyclic Sort
* Linked List Reversal
* Stack
* Matrix Traversal
* Prefix Sum

### üü° Intermediate Patterns:

* Hash Map
* Tree Traversals (BFS & DFS)
* Graph Algorithms
* Heap
* Binary Search Variants
* Top-K Elements
* Multi-way Merging
* Greedy Strategy
* Concurrency Basics

### üî¥ Advanced Patterns:

* Monotonic Stack
* Subsets and Combinations
* Bit Manipulation
* Dynamic Programming

    * 0/1 Knapsack
    * Unbounded Knapsack
    * Fibonacci Sequence
    * Palindromic Sequences
    * Longest Common Substrings
* Backtracking
* Trie
* Topological Sorting
* Union-Find
* Ordered Sets


## 4. Preparation Roadmaps

### a. Conceptual Roadmap
